# MethuselahOS

Methuselah OS is an in-developement Manjaro Linux distribution that strives
for ease-of-use and universal applications such as
package installers, specialised command correctors and more!

Methuselah also has a custom `neofetch` and an in-developement
KDE theme based upon the breeze KDE theme (3.1 as of writing). The first public alpha
of Methuselah OS is already available for download! Check it out at
