# Majoris KDE
Majoris KDE is a remix of Breeze, Breath and Relax KDE. We made this KDE especially for Methuselah OS to suit our needs. Even though Majoris KDE is basic we still feel that its enough for what its meant for, so please dont expect to many changes to the current build (version 0.31 as of writing).
